Heya everyone, myself batflarrorw, the combination of Batman Flash and Arrow.After two years of hell in jee coaching, i finally reached here.I thought I'll live "Majegi ki Zindagi", but frankly its the same hell. These kind of workshops and fest are the only thing that separates us from the shithole of a life we are living.I would really like to thank our seniors for organising such events and bringing us away from hell.
..
Thanks:)
